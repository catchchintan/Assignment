Problem 6
# Gaurav solves 5 questions correctly - 20.76% probability
# Barkha solves 5 questions correctly - 22.24% Probability
# G solves 4 & 6 correctly - 40%
# B solves 4 & 6 correctly - 38%
# Infer - Probability of solveing 5 correct questions is almost same for both G & B.
# Two factors affecting their ability is 1) no. of questions solving per day 2) success rate.
